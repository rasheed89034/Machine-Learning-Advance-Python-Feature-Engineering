# Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing 
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.
# Handling Imbalanced Datasets:  
Implementing SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance class distributions.
Using concat and make_classification to build and merge training sets for analysis.

# Outlier Detection & Treatment: 
Using the 1.5 × IQR (Interquartile Range) Rule to define Lower and Upper Fences.
Visualizing anomalies using Scatter Plots and Box Plots.
Statistical identification using Z-Scores.

# Categorical Encoding: 
Ordinal Encoding: Mapping ordered categories (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) to numerical ranks.

# Target Guided Ordinal Encoding: 
Encoding categories based on the mean of the target variable to capture hidden relationships.

# Tools & Libraries Used
## Python 3.12
## Pandas & NumPy: 
For data manipulation.
## Scikit-Learn: 
For OrdinalEncoder and resample.
## Matplotlib & Seaborn: 
For visualizing feature distributions and outliers.
